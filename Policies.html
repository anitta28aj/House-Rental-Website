        <p>The rental agreement is a legally binding document between tenants and property owners, outlining the responsibilities and rights of both parties. By confirming a booking, tenants agree to adhere to the terms specified, including payment obligations, property usage guidelines, and procedures regarding check-in and check-out. Property owners, in turn, commit to providing the property in good condition and addressing any issues that may arise during the rental period. This agreement is essential for ensuring a smooth rental experience and fostering trust between tenants and owners.</p>   </section>
