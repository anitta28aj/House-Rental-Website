# House-Rental-Website
"Dream Stays" is a dynamic house rental system designed for seamless interactions between tenants and property owners. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, the platform allows tenants to browse properties to buy, rent, or book for short-term stays. Meanwhile, property owners can easily post and manage listings, reaching a broad audience of potential tenants. This project offers an efficient and user-friendly experience for both tenants and property owners, catering to a variety of housing needs.
